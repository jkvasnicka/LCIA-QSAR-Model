Margins of Exposure (MOE) Metadata
==================================

Description
----------- 

This dataset contains estimates of margins of exposure, along with uncertainty 
represented in two ways: 

    (1) Exposure uncertainty for the population median individual.

    (2) Point of departure uncertainty, derived from the median root-mean 
        squared error from cross validation.

For more details, please refer to the manuscript by Kvasnicka et al. (2023).

Data sources
------------

The MOEs were derived from points of departure predicted by the "ML2" QSAR 
model, and exposure estimates predicted by the SEEM3 model by Ring et al. 
(2018). The data correspond to chemicals within the applicability domain of 
SEEM3.

Column Descriptions 
------------------- 

The columns follow a hierarchical naming convention where the first level is 
the Xth percentile of POD uncertainty, and the second level is the Pth 
percentile of exposure uncertainty for the population median individual.

    - DTXSID : The index column representing the unique chemical identifier.

    - POD_[X]%ile : Dimensionless MOE for the Xth percentile of POD 
        uncertainty. 

    - Median_Exposure_[P]%ile : Dimensionless MOE for the Pth percentile of 
        exposure uncertainty for the population median individual.

Usage Notes
-----------

The users should consider the context, limitations, and uncertainties of the 
data as detailed in the original papers. When using these data in publications 
or presentations, users should cite the original sources provided below.
