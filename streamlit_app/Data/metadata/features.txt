OPERA Features Metadata
=======================

Description
-----------

These features were used to train the "ML2" QSAR model for predicting points 
of departure. For more details, please refer to the manuscript by Kvasnicka et 
al. (2023).

Data Source
-----------

The raw features were computed using OPERA 2.9. The following preprocessing 
was then applied:

    - Converted log-transformed features into natural units

    - Tagged the column names of discrete features with a suffix

Column Descriptions
-------------------

- DTXSID : The index column representing the unique chemical identifier.

- For remaining columns, please see "Feature Descriptions" below.

Usage Notes
-----------

The users should consider the context, limitations, and uncertainties of the 
data as detailed in the original papers. When using these data in publications 
or presentations, users should cite the original sources provided below.
